Hi! I’m Joyce, a full-stack engineer sophomore studying CS and business part of the Texas CSB honors program. 

My career goals lie ultimately in tech product management, but I want to start my career in software development, interacting directly with a code base. That’s why I’m seeking 2021 Summer internships in software engineering internships. This summer I worked with a team of three other females to develop a cross platform app using React Native that addressed fast fashion issues. While school projects have been challenging and fun, I’ve also gotten to see my ability to make impactful tech through these side projects. I’d love to work at a company who values the same thing: customer and impact!
